            We focus on semi-supervised node classification using GNNs and formulate the <em>Corrective Unlearning</em> 
            problem for graph-structured data. Consider a graph <em>G=(V,E)</em>, where <em>V</em> and <em>E</em> 
            represent the constituent set of nodes and edges respectively.

          <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Unlearning requests can be of the form to unlearn one or more of nodes and edges of the graph, 
            where for each node <em>V<sub>i</sub> âˆˆ V</em>, we have a feature vector <em>X<sub>i</sub></em> 
            and label <em>Y<sub>i</sub></em>, where <em>V = (X, Y)</em>.

            <strong>Can we unlearn the effect of all the devil nodes (red and black) while discovering only a few (red)?</strong> 
            This problem is interesting in graphs because the effect of a node can propagate to other nodes through message passing.
